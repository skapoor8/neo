# Infrastructure

## Overview

`neo` is a [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev/)-powered project with automated versioning, testing, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.

## Design

- Mise manages environment, dev tools, and tasks
- GitHub Actions drives CI/CD using mise tasks
- Org-level secrets avoid per-project secret configuration
- The build system is project-structure agnostic — only mise tasks need to work

## Implementation

### Mise For Environment & Tasks

Mise is the environment management tool and task runner. Since mise can manage a large array of languages and tools, it is a sensible choice for a language-agnostic build system that hooks into CI/CD and can be modified for any language.

Environment is configured in `mise.toml` under `[env]`:

```toml
[env]
GCP_REGISTRY_PROJECT_ID = "your-project-id"
GCP_REGISTRY_REGION     = "us-central1"
GCP_REGISTRY_NAME       = "your-repository-name"
```

### GitHub Actions For CI/CD

The `ci` workflow runs on feature branch commits and publishes pre-release packages for testing. The `release` workflow runs on merge to main, where `semantic-release` bumps versions and updates the changelog.

### CI/CD Secrets

Org-level secrets are utilized to avoid the need for setting up secrets for every new project. This means setup is only needed once.

For GCP (default):

- `GCP_SA_KEY` - Service account JSON key
- `GCP_REGISTRY_PROJECT_ID`, `GCP_REGISTRY_REGION`, `GCP_REGISTRY_NAME` - Registry configuration

For other registries (see [user-guide.md](user-guide.md#cicd-secrets) for details):

- npm: `NPM_TOKEN`
- PyPI: `PYPI_TOKEN`
- Docker Hub: `DOCKER_USERNAME`, `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

### Cross-Platform Support

The project works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL) without requiring platform-specific tools.

Key compatibility measures:

- Mise handles installation of tools across host platforms
- Line endings enforced to LF via `.editorconfig`
- Bash 3.2+ required (macOS ships with Bash 3.2)

### Docker & Dev-Containers

Supported for workflows that require containerization or publishing containers.
